Nodemon is a tool that helps to run and develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node 
application when file changes in the directory are detected. To install it, use either one of the commands:
    npm install -g nodemon //where -g means nodemon will be installed globally to your system path and hence you can use it from anywhere (Recommended)
    npm install --save-dev nodemon //install nodemon as a development dependency
After installing nodemon, do this or else it won't work as running scripts is disabled on this system:
Step 1 : Go to this location --> File C:\Users\"USERNAME"\AppData\Roaming\npm, where "USERNAME" is the username you specified for your computer
Step 2 : Delete the nodemon powershell (nodemon.ps1) file and you will be good to go.

Nodemon wraps your application, so instead of the usual way of running a node.js file (i.e. node [your node app]), 
you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app to run your file:
    nodemon [your node app]
