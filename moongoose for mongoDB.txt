The first argument is the singular name of the collection your model is for. Mongoose automatically looks for the plural version of your model name. For example, if you use

const MyModel = mongoose.model('Ticket', mySchema);
Then MyModel will use the tickets collection, not the ticket collection.

Mongoose has several built-in validators.

All SchemaTypes have the built-in required validator. The required validator uses the SchemaType's checkRequired() function to determine if the value satisfies the required validator.
Numbers have min and max validators.
Strings have enum, match, minLength, and maxLength validators.

You can configure the error message for individual validators in your schema. There are two equivalent ways to set the validator error message:

Array syntax: min: [6, 'Must be at least 6, got {VALUE}']
Object syntax: enum: { values: ['Coffee', 'Tea'], message: '{VALUE} is not supported' }

Your schemas can define default values for certain paths. If you create a new document without that path set, 
the default will kick in. Mongoose only applies a default if the value of the path is strictly undefined.
You can also set the default schema option to a function. Mongoose will execute that function and use the return value as 
the default.
